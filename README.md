# üèÖ EDA on Olympic Dataset

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Olympic Games dataset to uncover insights, trends, and interesting visualizations related to athletes' performances, participating countries, medal tallies, and historical data over time.

## üìÇ Dataset

The analysis is based on the [Kaggle Olympic Athletes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results), which contains detailed records from 1896 to 2016. There are two datasets:

1. `athlete_events.csv`: contains **271116 rows** and **15 columns**. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event.
- The columns are:

|        ID         |        Name         |        Sex         |        Age         |        Height         |        Weight         |        Team         |        NOC         |        Games         |        Year         |        Season         |        City         |        Sport         |        Event         |        Medal         |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|

2. `noc_regions.csv`: contains **203 rows** and **3 columns**. Each row consist of NOC Code and the respective region.
- The columns are:
  
|NOC|region|notes|

## üîé Future Work

- Does having a home advantage provide nations a benefit in terms of medals?
- We can additionally include the Paralympics data.
- Does the nation's Olympic accomplishment rely on its wealth (GDP)?
- How do a country's Olympics and climate relate to one another?
- Instead of tallying every individual for a team event we can count it as one medal.
